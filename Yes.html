  <h1>In your arms. I'm home</h1>
    <h4>You are the only one who I wouldn't mind losing sleep for,</h4>
    <h4>the only one who I can never get tired of talking to</h4>
    <h4>and the only one who crosses my mind constantly throughout the day.</h4>
    <h4>You are the only one who can make me smile without any intentions</h4>
    <h4>and affect my emotions with every action of yours.</h4>
    <h4>I can't explain in words how much you mean to me.</h4>
    <h4>You are the one I'm afraid of losing and the one I want to keep in my life.</h4>
    <h4>Our journey isn't perfect, but it's ours and I'll stick till the end with you.</h4>
    <h4>Last but not least...</h4>
    <h4>Coming for you was like arriving home to a place I have never been</h4>
    <h4>but had been yearning for my whole life.</h4>
    <h4>Happy Valentine's day my Love, Cuddle Buddy and Bestie</h4>
  <h2>I Love Yoouuuuuuuuu!!!</h2>
